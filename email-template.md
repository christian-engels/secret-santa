Hi again {first_name_from},

**SantaBot** here - there was a gross bug in the Christmas pudding that startled me and screwed up my Secret Santa assignments. Please scratch my last email.

For _REAL_ this time: you are the Secret Santa for **{first_name_to}** at our Christmas Get Together, yay-squared!

Again, the simple rules are: 
- The **budget is Â£10** and no one is expected to go over. (Seriously!) 
- **Don't reveal yourself!** We will do so collectively after everyone received their gift. 
- Participation is optional but do let Christian know in good time to reassign. 
- We are a reasonable bunch, so gifts will surely be appropriate.

For your amusement, here is the [Secret Santa clip from The Office (US)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19ulSNSRKyU)... cringe!

And also further below a bit of background reading on the Secret Santa tradition.

Happy Gifting!

**Word on the Street: A Sneaky Tradition That Grew Up Stealthily** by Ben Zimmer (Dec, 2023)

The Wall Street Journal

With the holiday season in full swing, Secret Santa gift exchanges are flourishing among friends, family members and co-workers. It's become a time-honored Yuletide tradition: A small group of people hold a random drawing to match gift recipients with their anonymous givers. Then when everyone gathers for the gift swap, the identities of the Secret Santas are revealed.

The exchanges have become so commonplace that online outlets are full of Secret Santa gift-giving guides. But how did this Christmastime ritual get its alliterative name in the first place? There's a secret history behind "Secret Santa."

Santa Claus has been a folkloric figure associated with Christmas since American colonial times, derived from the Dutch name for St. Nicholas. In the Dutch dialect of the New York colony, the jolly gift-giver was known as "Sante Klaas," and as early as 1773 his name was rendered as "St. A Claus" in a notice in the New York Gazette. As the Santa Claus legend took shape in the mid-19th century, his moniker could get shortened simply to "Santa." A Christmas Eve verse from 1850 in Rhode Island's Newport Daily News went, "Sound the trumpets, beat the drums, Lo and behold, old Santa comes."

The phrase "secret Santa" didn't appear in U.S. newspapers until the early 20th century, and when it did, it could simply refer to an anonymous benefactor distributing Christmas gifts to needy children. It would take several decades for "Secret Santa" to get attached to gift swaps, but in the meantime, the practice began developing under different names in the American heartland.

One early breeding ground was Nebraska, where sororities and other social clubs for young women popularized the tradition. In 1925, for instance, the Harlan County Journal reported on a meeting of the Busy Bee Club: "Christmas gifts will be exchanged at this time and secret club sisters will be revealed." And in 1929, the Atkinson Graphic carried an account of a Christmas party for the local chapter of the P.E.O. Sisterhood, in which each member was given a present from her "Mystery Sister."

Clandestine gift swaps on the Nebraska model soon spread to other states, sometimes under the name "secret pals" or "secret sisters." The "secret pals" designation would eventually find its counterpart in Latin America, where the equivalent of Secret Santa is often called "amigo secreto." (The "secret sisters" name has also lingered into the 21st century. A "secret sister" gift exchange on Facebook was recently revealed to be a pyramid scheme.)

While one sorority at Indiana State University had a "Sneaky Santa Week" as early as 1958, "Secret Santa" did not start becoming a popular appellation for another few years. A Methodist Youth Fellowship in Frankfort, Kansas, exchanged gifts via "Secret Santa" in 1961, and two years later, the practice had made its way to the East Coast, with the Home News of New Brunswick, N.J., reporting, "'Secret Santas' were debearded right and left at Linwood School yesterday after a week of anonymous little gifts and pleasantries."

By the early 1980s, "Secret Santa" exchanges had found favor on many college campuses, from Chapel Hill in North Carolina to Smith and Amherst in Massachusetts, sometimes accompanied by elaborate rituals of gift-giving. It also has become an unavoidable staple of office culture, as spoofed on episodes of the NBC sitcoms "30 Rock" and "The Office."

And for those who find "Secret Santa" too staid, there are variations on the theme like "Dirty Santa" (a "white elephant" swap where gifts can be "stolen") and "Conspiracy Santa" (wherein a group conspires to get a gift for one person). But no matter which version of the game you play, the simple pleasures of Secret Santa are hiding in plain sight.
